# Accum_Mut_Del
Code files for the third chapter of my PhD thesis "Accumulation of recessive deleterious mutations near a mating-type locus in selfing recombining and non-recombining individuals"

The file "Accum_Mut_Del_Simulations" contains the necessary R code to simulate the population described in chapter 3 of the manuscript. 
The first part is the implementation of the model, with the package IBMPopSim
The second part displays the functions used for figures 3.4 and 3.5

Figure 3.3 is obtained with python script Heatmaps_Figure3_3.py
